# Intro  
This final project was created for a the CSE 125 class in UCSC taught by Dustin Richmond.
This recreates the Konami game Dance Dance Revolution(DDR) on an FPGA.
The FPGA used for this project is the iCEBreaker FPGA.  

The features that were implemented are
* Making and reading from charts
* Arrows movement and launching
* Button presses
* Sheet music timing (limited to 4/4 time signature)  

More info down below on unimplemented features and how to read and make charts.  

Special thanks to Will Green and his Project F design and tutorials.
His Pong implementation was used as a skeleton for my game and helped me understand how to display graphics through the DVI Pmod.
